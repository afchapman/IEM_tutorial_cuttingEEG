# IEM_tutorial_cuttingEEG

To run these tutorials, you'll need to download two data files:

* [EEG_basic.mat](https://osf.io/t5jxk)
* [EEG_advanced.mat](https://osf.io/ewqm8)

Create a 'data' directory within the folder where IEM_tutorial_basics.m/advanced.m live and place the two .mat files inside it.
